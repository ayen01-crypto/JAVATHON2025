# Operators & Expressions

This section contains Java programs that demonstrate various operators and expressions in Java.

## Programs

### 1. CompoundInterest.java
A Java program that calculates compound interest using A = P(1 + r/n)^(n*t).

**Features:**
- Implements the compound interest formula
- Uses Math.pow() for exponentiation
- Takes principal, rate, time, and compounding frequency as inputs

### 2. BooleanOperations.java
A program that takes two boolean inputs and prints the results of AND, OR, and XOR operations.

**Features:**
- Demonstrates logical operators
- Shows truth table results
- Uses boolean data type operations

### 3. RemainderCalculator.java
A program to read two integers and show the remainder when the first is divided by the second.

**Features:**
- Uses modulus operator (%)
- Handles division by zero error
- Shows remainder calculation

### 4. IncrementDecrement.java
A program that demonstrates increment and decrement operators step by step on a given number.

**Features:**
- Shows pre-increment (++x) vs post-increment (x++)
- Shows pre-decrement (--x) vs post-decrement (x--)
- Demonstrates operator behavior differences

### 5. QuadraticEquation.java
A civil engineer wants to find the roots of a quadratic equation.

**Features:**
- Solves quadratic equations of the form ax² + bx + c = 0
- Handles real and complex roots
- Calculates discriminant to determine root types

## How to Run
To compile and run any of these programs, use the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
javac ProgramName.java
java ProgramName
```

Replace `ProgramName` with the actual name of the Java file (without the .java extension).
