# Variables & Data Types

This section contains Java programs that demonstrate the use of different variable types and data manipulation.

## Programs

### 1. PrimitiveDataTypes.java
A Java program to declare variables of all primitive data types, assign values, and print each value and its type.

**Features:**
- Declares all 8 primitive data types in Java
- Shows the range and characteristics of each type
- Displays values with their corresponding data types

### 2. TemperatureConverter.java
A program that converts a temperature entered in Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.

**Features:**
- Implements both conversion formulas
- User can choose conversion direction
- Uses floating-point arithmetic for precision

### 3. NumberSwap.java
A program to swap two numbers without using a temporary variable.

**Features:**
- Uses arithmetic operations to swap values
- Demonstrates alternative to traditional swapping
- Shows mathematical approach to problem solving

### 4. CircleCalculator.java
A program to calculate and display the area and circumference of a circle given its radius.

**Features:**
- Uses Math.PI constant for precision
- Implements circle formulas
- Takes radius as input from user

### 5. DaysLived.java
A health app needs to estimate how many days a person has lived.

**Features:**
- Converts years to days using simple multiplication
- Assumes 365 days per year
- Demonstrates basic arithmetic operations

## How to Run
To compile and run any of these programs, use the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
javac ProgramName.java
java ProgramName
```

Replace `ProgramName` with the actual name of the Java file (without the .java extension).
