# Control Flow - Loops

This section contains Java programs that demonstrate various loop constructs and iterative operations.

## Programs

### 1. MultiplicationTable.java
A Java program that prints the multiplication table of any number up to 12.

**Features:**
- Uses for loop for repetition
- Generates multiplication table for any given number
- Formats output in a readable table format

### 2. PrimeNumbers.java
A program that displays all prime numbers between 1 and 100.

**Features:**
- Implements prime number detection algorithm
- Uses nested loops for efficiency
- Optimizes checking up to square root of number

### 3. Factorial.java
A program to find the factorial of a number using a for loop.

**Features:**
- Calculates factorial using iterative approach
- Handles edge cases (0! = 1)
- Uses long data type to handle larger results

### 4. Fibonacci.java
A program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to N terms.

**Features:**
- Generates Fibonacci sequence iteratively
- Handles special cases for first two terms
- Efficiently calculates sequence without recursion

### 5. ReverseDigits.java
A ticketing system needs to reverse seat numbers for final verification.

**Features:**
- Reverses digits of an integer
- Handles negative numbers correctly
- Uses mathematical operations to extract and rebuild number

## How to Run
To compile and run any of these programs, use the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
javac ProgramName.java
java ProgramName
```

Replace `ProgramName` with the actual name of the Java file (without the .java extension).
