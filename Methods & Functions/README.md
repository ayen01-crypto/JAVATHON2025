# Methods & Functions

This section contains Java programs that demonstrate method creation, usage, and different programming paradigms.

## Programs

### 1. GCDCalculator.java
A Java method that returns the GCD of two numbers and call it from main.

**Features:**
- Implements Euclidean algorithm for GCD calculation
- Uses recursive approach for elegant solution
- Handles negative numbers with absolute values

### 2. PowerCalculator.java
A recursive method to calculate the power of a number (base^exponent).

**Features:**
- Implements recursive power calculation
- Handles negative exponents
- Base case handling for exponent = 0

### 3. ArmstrongNumber.java
A method to check if a number is an Armstrong number.

**Features:**
- Determines number of digits dynamically
- Calculates sum of digits raised to power of digit count
- Compares sum with original number

### 4. DecimalToBinary.java
A method that converts a decimal number to binary.

**Features:**
- Implements division-by-2 algorithm
- Uses StringBuilder for efficient string building
- Handles edge case of zero

### 5. CustomSort.java
A teacher wants to sort exam marks without using library functions.

**Features:**
- Implements bubble sort algorithm
- Sorts array in ascending order
- Works with arrays of any size

## How to Run
To compile and run any of these programs, use the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
javac ProgramName.java
java ProgramName
```

Replace `ProgramName` with the actual name of the Java file (without the .java extension).
