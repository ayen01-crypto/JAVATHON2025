# Control Flow - If/Else

This section contains Java programs that demonstrate conditional statements and decision making using if/else constructs.

## Programs

### 1. LeapYear.java
A Java program to determine if a given year is a leap year.

**Features:**
- Implements leap year rules (divisible by 4, except for years divisible by 100 unless also divisible by 400)
- Uses nested conditional statements
- Provides clear output indicating leap year status

### 2. NumberChecker.java
A program to read an integer and print whether it's positive, negative, or zero.

**Features:**
- Uses if-else-if ladder for multiple conditions
- Handles all integer values including zero
- Simple and clear output

### 3. GradeCalculator.java
A program that reads a student's marks and outputs the letter grade (A–F).

**Features:**
- Implements grading scale with multiple ranges
- Uses if-else-if ladder for grade classification
- Handles invalid input outside valid range

### 4. CharacterType.java
A program to check if a character is uppercase, lowercase, digit, or special symbol.

**Features:**
- Uses Character class methods for type checking
- Handles all ASCII character types
- Provides detailed classification

### 5. TriangleClassifier.java
A construction firm needs to classify triangles.

**Features:**
- Classifies triangles as equilateral, isosceles, or scalene
- Validates triangle formation using triangle inequality
- Compares side lengths for classification

## How to Run
To compile and run any of these programs, use the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
javac ProgramName.java
java ProgramName
```

Replace `ProgramName` with the actual name of the Java file (without the .java extension).
