# Arrays

This section contains Java programs that demonstrate array operations and manipulation.

## Programs

### 1. ArrayReverse.java
A Java program to read N integers into an array and print them in reverse order.

**Features:**
- Dynamic array creation based on user input
- Reads multiple integers into array
- Prints array elements in reverse order using backward loop

### 2. ArrayMinMax.java
A program to find the largest and smallest numbers in an array.

**Features:**
- Finds minimum and maximum values in a single pass
- Handles arrays of any size
- Initializes comparison values properly

### 3. ArrayAverage.java
A program to compute the average of array elements.

**Features:**
- Calculates sum of all elements
- Computes average using floating-point division
- Handles both integer and decimal results

### 4. ArrayMergeSort.java
A program that merges two arrays and prints the sorted result.

**Features:**
- Merges two separate arrays into one
- Implements bubble sort algorithm
- Handles arrays of different sizes

### 5. AttendanceCounter.java
A school records daily attendance numbers.

**Features:**
- Counts occurrences of a specific value in array
- Searches through array elements
- Provides frequency count as output

## How to Run
To compile and run any of these programs, use the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
javac ProgramName.java
java ProgramName
```

Replace `ProgramName` with the actual name of the Java file (without the .java extension).
